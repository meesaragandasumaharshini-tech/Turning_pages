Turning Pages is a full-stack personal digital bookshelf where I document the books I've read, share my ratings, and write personal reviews. Visitors can explore my collection, search by title, author, or genre, and sort books alphabetically or by rating. This project was built as part of my web development capstone project using Node.js, Express, EJS, PostgreSQL, and the Open Library Covers API.
